# Simulator
The assembler will read and parse the contents of a simple MIPS program (program-name.asm). Each line of the program contains an MIPS instruction or a directive. No line is blank. A label will not appear on a line by itself. Operands are comma-separated. There will be no white spaces between operands. No line will begin with white spaces. The assembler generates an output file of size 1KB consisting of 512B of data segment (begins at 0x0000) and 512B of text segment (begins at 0x0200). Since each data and instruction is 4B long, there will be at maximum 128 word data and at maximum 128 instruction words. This file can be considered a binary executable file.
